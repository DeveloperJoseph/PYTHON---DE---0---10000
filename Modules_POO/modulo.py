## PYTHON MODULES ##

#What's a module?:
# - Consider a module to be the same as code library.
# - A file containing a set of functions you want to include in your 
#   application.

#Create a Module: 
#To create a module just save the code you want in a file with the file
#extension .py:
#Example:
    #Save this code in a file name 'module.py'

def greeting(name):
    print("Hello, ",name)

#Variables in Module:
# The module can contain functions, as already described,
# but also variables of all types(arrays,dictionaries,objects,etc):
#Example of a dictonary:
person = {
    "name":"Joseph",
    "age":18,
    "country":"UK"
}
